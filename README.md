I created terraform config files for the infra and the linux vm to host the docker container. OI had the option to deploy the app using Amazon ecs or build a custom cicd pipeline to fully automate the build process using jenkins as my integration tool together with maven for the build, sonarqube for code coverage, ansible for deployment and prometheus and grafana for monitoring. But due to my current job demands, time constraint became a major issue. 
I only did a few steps in the entire process. I promise to complete the rest.
So, I am definietly coming back to explore these other options for fully automated deployment.
And I'll also put down a full documentation of the processes and steps I took to deploy it.
